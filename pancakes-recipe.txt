INGREDIENTS

3 eggs
450 ml milk
1 bag vanilla sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
pinch of salt
1 tablespoon oil
250 g flour
100 g sugar

PREPARATION

1. Put everything in a bowl.
2. Mix it using hand-mixer or a similar kitchen appliance.
3. Check if you like the texture of the dough - add more flour if it's too watery or more milk if it's too solid.
4. Put a pan on the hob, pour a bit of oil on it, wait for it to heat properly (2/3 setting of the hob).
5. Once the pan is heated, pour about 1/2 of a standard soup ladle of the dough.
6. Wait a few minutes for the dough to become ready for turning and then turn. Wait some more - the pancake is ready. Take it off the pan, add some more oil, wait a moment for it to heat and thus repeat until all pancakes are ready.
7. If something went wrong and the pancakes are not the way you like them, make note of it so you won't repeat the mistake next time!
